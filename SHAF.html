                            After graduating and becoming independent, I started living on my own. Unlike living with family, the biggest problem when living alone is that there is a lot of food waste. Nowadays, as the number of people living alone is increasing, I expected that there would be many people with the same concerns as me. Also, as environmental awareness is rapidly promoted, the movement to solve food waste problem will increase. I have created this application with the intention of solving the problem of one-person households' food waste.

                        <p>Since the service is particularly related to food ingredients, I tried to find a way to give users trust, and this became the most important goal of the project.</p><br>

                        <p><strong><u>2. Process clarity is important</u></strong></p>
                        <p>When I first conceived the service, the process of sharing-being shared was not clear, so there were many parts where I myself was confused. By creating a user flow, it was able to clearly redefine the service process, and I tried to devise a process that users could understand as much as possible.</p><br>

                        <p><strong><u>3. The purpose of using the service may be different for each user</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Since the service was divided into two types of users, those who share and those who receive sharing, it was important to devise a service flow according to the user's purpose of use. The application was created so that two types of users can achieve their goals without being confused in the same app.</p>
